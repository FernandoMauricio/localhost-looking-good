## Installation

Clone the repository to your localhost root directory:

git clone https://github.com/andergtk/localhost-looking-good.git /var/www
```

Make sure that the directory is empty.

Remove the `README.md` and `LICENSE` files if you want, to let the cleanest folder.

Or [download](https://github.com/andergtk/localhost-looking-good/archive/master.zip) the repository and copy the `.htaccess` file and `.localhost/` directory into your localhost root folder.

If needed, change the value of the constants in the file `.localhost/index.php` to the correct paths.
